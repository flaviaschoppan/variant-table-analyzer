# Variant Table Analyzer

This repository contains a technical demonstration of post-processing operations commonly applied to annotated genetic variant tables.

It illustrates how variant-level data can be parsed, filtered, and aggregated using simple and explicit data manipulation steps, with the goal of demonstrating code structure and data handling patterns.

This project is not intended for clinical interpretation, variant prioritization, or biological decision-making.  

It is maintained as a technical reference and is not under active development.
